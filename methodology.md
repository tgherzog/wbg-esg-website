The World Bank’s ESG Data Framework provides information on 17
key sustainability themes spanning environmental, social, and governance
categories:

Environment                            | Social                 | Governance
-------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------
Emissions & pollution                  | Education & skills     | Human rights
Natural capital endowment & management | Employment             | Government effectiveness
Energy use & security                  | Demography             | Stability & rule of law
Environment/climate risk & resilience  | Poverty & inequality   | Economic environment
Food security                          | Health & nutrition     | Gender
                                       | Access to services     | Innovation

The ESG Data Framework incorporates data relevant to all 17 [Sustainable
Development Goals][sdgs]. The Framework organizes data into themes the World Bank
believes are crucial for financial sector representatives to consider when
assessing the contribution of investments or policies to sustainable
development. The initial set of indicators has been based on:

* Survey of World Bank data currently used by investors
* Indicators relevant to World Bank's own policy analysis
* Other key indicators identified through analysis of World Bank expert teams
* Availability, coverage, timeliness of data

In the first version of the Portal, countries are not scored or ranked;
however there is the possibility for this application in a later version of the
Portal. The first version provides ESG data to the financial sector and to
governments, and lets users perform their own analyses.

<table class="table">
<thead><tr><th>Theme</th><th>Relevance</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Environment</td>
<td>This category encompasses key themes, which provide a picture of the
sustainability of a country’s economic performance given its natural resource
endowment, management and supplementation and its risk or resilience to climate
change and other natural hazards. This category pays particular attention to
the internalization of environmental externalities created by economic
activity. This category also accounts for sustainable energy access and food
security, crucial factors for stable long-term economic growth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Social</td>
<td>This category encompasses key themes, which provide a picture of the
sustainability of a country’s economic performance given its efficacy meeting
the basic needs of its population and reducing poverty, management of social
and equity issues and investment in human capital and productivity. This
category also includes demographic criteria, pertinent to stable long-term
economic growth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Governance</td>
<td>This category encompasses key themes, which provide a picture of the
sustainability of a country’s economic performance given its institutional
capacity to support long-term stability, growth and poverty reduction. This
category also accounts for the strength of a country’s political, financial and
legal systems and capacity to address environmental and social risks.</td>

### Next Steps ###

The data in the ESG Data Framework will be expanded in the coming months and
years to include new data that the WBG views as crucial to increase financial
flows to activities aligned with sustainable development. Such data will
include information the World Bank has collected on natural capital and human
capital, leveraging The [Changing Wealth of Nations][won] work. Additional data from
geospatial technology, artificial intelligence and other developing sources of
proxy indicators will be added over time.

Forward-looking data (particularly on climate mitigation, adaptation, and
impacts) is becoming increasingly important for governments and investors, and
will be added to the Portal. Metadata, too, will be added to the Portal, to
explain the relevance of various indicators to a country’s sustainability
performance and the materiality of time lags.
