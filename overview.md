A growing body of research demonstrating the materiality of ESG criteria
indicates that investors need to manage and assess ESG risks and opportunities
associated with their investments. While corporate disclosure of ESG criteria is
becoming more mainstream, the World Bank has found ESG data at the sovereign level
is lagging. Demand for better
country level ESG data from trusted sources was one of the findings of an
ongoing joint research program between WBG and Japan’s [Government Pension
Investment Fund][gpif] (GPIF).

In order to shift financial flows so that they are better aligned with global
goals, the World Bank Group (WBG) is working to provide financial markets with
improved data and analytics that shed light on countries’ sustainability
performance. Along with new information and tools, the World Bank will also
develop research on the correlation between countries’ sustainability
performance and the risk and return profiles of relevant investments. 

This work is part of the newly launched [Global Program on Sustainability][gps] (GPS),
which aims to provide governments and investors with information and tools that
improve their understanding of sustainability criteria, including through
natural capital accounting. Providing improved ESG data to the financial sector
is a key component of the [Incentives][gps-themes] pillar of GPS, which is led by the
[Finance, Competitiveness, and Innovation][fci] (FCI) Global Practice. 

The World Bank’s [ESG Data Methodology][fw] provides information on 17
key sustainability themes spanning environmental, social, and governance
categories:


Environment                            | Social                 | Governance
-------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------
Emissions & pollution                  | Education & skills     | Human rights
Natural capital endowment & management | Employment             | Government effectiveness
Energy use & security                  | Demography             | Stability & rule of law
Environment/climate risk & resilience  | Poverty & inequality   | Economic environment
Food security                          | Health & nutrition     | Gender
                                       | Access to services     | Innovation

### How to use ESG data ###

This portal provides you several options for accessing and using the available data:

* The [interactive data explorer](explorer.html) allows you to see all indicators for a
  country, with regional and global aggregates for reference
* The [country dashboards](dashboards.html) provide ESG profiles at the country level
* You may download the bulk dataset from the [World Bank data catalog][ddh]
* The dataset is also available via [Databank][databank] or [API][api1] (API docs [are here][api2])
* **Documentation:** read the [ESG Data Methodology][fw] or [ESG Data Framework](framework.html)
