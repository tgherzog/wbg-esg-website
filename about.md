A growing body of research demonstrating the materiality of ESG criteria
indicates that investors need to manage and assess ESG risks and opportunities
associated with their investments – for all asset classes. Better ESG data can
also help channel financial flows to more sustainable activities that are
better aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals.

The World Bank Group (WBG) has been collaborating with investors and other
market participants to provide financial markets with improved sovereign ESG
data and analytics that increase transparency around countries’ sustainability
performance. This [Sovereign ESG Data Portal](explorer.html) is part of the work supported by
the [Global Program on Sustainability][gps] (GPS), which aims to provide governments
and investors with information and tools that improve their understanding of
sustainability criteria, including through natural capital accounting.
Providing improved ESG data to the financial sector is a key component of the
[Incentives][gps-themes] pillar of GPS, which is led by the [Finance, Competitiveness, and
Innovation][fci] (FCI) Global Practice in collaboration with the [World Bank Treasury][tre],
Country Credit Risk Group and other groups.

The [Sovereign ESG Data Framework][fw] incorporates data relevant to all 17
Sustainable Development Goals. The Framework organizes data into themes the
World Bank considers to be crucial for financial sector representatives to
consider when assessing the contribution of investments or policies to
sustainable development. The data set will evolve over time. The initial set of
indicators has been based on:

* Survey of World Bank data currently used by investors
* Indicators relevant to World Bank's own policy analysis
* Other key indicators identified through analysis of World Bank expert teams
* Availability, coverage, timeliness of data
