### World Bank Reports

* [Incorporating Environmental, Social and Governance Factors Into Fixed Income Investment](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/913961524150628959) \\
  The result of a partnership between the World Bank Group and Government
  Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) of Japan: to collaborate on initiatives that
  promote strategies for including environmental, social and governance (ESG)
  criteria in investment decisions across asset classes.

* [Governance Improvements and Sovereign Financing Costs in Developing Countries](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/621451560196188919) \\
  Using a novel methodology based onestimating sovereign credit ratings using
  the Moody's scorecard, and examining the associations between these ratings
  and the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
  (CPIA) scores, this paper examines how making improvements in the quality of
  economic policies andinstitutions can help lower governments' financing costs.

* [The Changing Wealth of Nations 2018](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/29001) \\
  Countries regularly track gross domestic product (GDP) as an indicator of
  their economic progress, but not wealth—the assets such as infrastructure,
  forests, minerals, and human capital that produce GDP. In contrast,
  corporations routinely report on both their income and assets to assess their
  economic health and prospects for the future. Wealth accounts allow countries
  to take stock of their assets to monitor the sustainability of development,
  an urgent concern today for all countries. The Changing Wealth of Nations
  2018 covers national wealth for 141 countries over 20 years (1995–2014).
